# Leopards and Lions and Boars, Oh My!

## Research by Leonie Henkes, Natalie DiMattia, and Abigail Smith

At the 2019 Homer Multitext Summer Seminar, we examined the Homeric simile in book 17, [lines 19-23](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_224v_225r@0.2320,0.4553,0.07997,0.02818&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_224v_225r@0.003602,0.3391,0.1622,0.2785&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:e3bifolio.v1:E3_224v_225r@0.1584,0.4490,0.03002,0.08526). This passage occurs after the death of Patroclus, while Menelaus and Euphorbus are fighting over his body. After Euphorbus speaks, boasting about his strength, Menelaus begins his response with the following simile.

>Ζεῦ περ~ οὐ μὲν καλὸν ὑπέρβιον εὐχετάασθαι~ /
>οὔτ' οὖν πορδάλιος τόσσον μενος, οὔτε λέοντος /
>οὔτε συὸς κάπρου ὀλοόφρονος~ οὗ τε μέγιστος /
>θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι περὶ σθένεϊ βλεμεαίνει, /
>ὅσσον Πάνθου υἷες ἐϋμμελίαι φορέουσιν~

>Father Zeus! It is not good to boast excessively. / Neither is the strength of the leopard so great, nor of the lion, / nor of the crafty pig boar, whose mightiest / spirit in his chest exults in his strength,/ as that which the sons of Panthous, good-with-the-ash-spear, possess.
(Translated by Leonie Henkes, Natalie DiMattia, and Abigail Smith)

In the “Twins” manuscripts, this passage’s spelling of πορδάλιος (the leopard) conflicts with the spelling of the word in the edition of T. W. Allen, as published by the Perseus Digital Library. This version spells the word παρδάλιος with an α. Πορδάλιος has two scholion markers in the Upsilon 1.1 manuscript. 1 refers to an original scholion and one refers to a secondhand, later addition, as shown below.

The original scholion did not answer the spelling question. Rather, he explains the order of the animals as they appear in the simile.

>πρῶτον ἔθηκε τὸν πόρδαλιν ~ θρασὺ γὰρ τὸ ζῶον τοῦτο ~ δεύτερον δὲ τὸν λέοντα ~ μετὰ γὰρ θράσους δεῖ καὶ ἀλκῆς ~ τρίτον σῦν ~ οὐχ'ὡς γενναιότερον , ἀλλ' ὡς ἀλογίστῳ ὁρμῇ φερόμενον ~ λεόντων καὶ πορδάλεων πολλάκις τὸ παθεῖν φυλασσομένων ~ δια τοῦτο ἐπήνεγκεν οὗ τε μέγιστος θυμός ~ ἄλλως τε ~ λέων μὲν καὶ πόρδαλις πολλάκις ἡμεροῦνται ~ οὗτος δὲ ἀεὶ ἄγριος⁑

>First he uses the leopard, for this animal is bold. Second, he uses the lion, for with courage one also needs fighting spirit. Third, boar, not because it is more noble, but because it is carried along by unthinking assault, while the lions and leopards are often on guard against suffering. Because of that he (“Homer”) included "the spirit is the greatest". And differently, the lion and leopard are often tamed but he (the boar) is always wild. (Translated by Ineke Sluiter, Leonie Henkes, Natalie DiMattia, and Abigail Smith)

This scholion does not address the semantics of the spelling of πορδάλιος, but it does address the literary, symbolic reasons for ordering the animals in this way. When cross-referenced with the [Venetus B](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vbbifolio.v1:vb_231v_232r@0.04083,0.3591,0.1442,0.2473&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vbbifolio.v1:vb_231v_232r@0.1952,0.4417,0.2486,0.1057), the two manuscripts both shared this scholion. Remarkably, the Venetus B included a later addition in a different hand, which commented on the spelling of πορδάλιος. This addition reads:

>πόρδαλις ἀρσένϊκον~ ἀπὸ τοῦ προσάλλεσθαι δὲ γΐνεται~ πάρδαλις δὲ θηλυκὸν~ ἀπὸ τοῦ παραβάλλεσθαι⁑

>"πόρδαλις" (leopard) is masculine. It comes from the word "προσάλλεσθαι" (to leap towards). "πάρδαλις" is feminine. From "παραβάλλεσθαι"

The Upsilon 1.1 manuscript also has a later addition, indicated by the second mark in the text, in the form of an intermarginal scholion which includes the same message.

Then, turning to the [Venetus A](http://www.homermultitext.org/ict2/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA223VN_0725@0.4392,0.5960,0.05637,0.03804&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA223VN_0725@0.2275,0.7149,0.6629,0.04426&urn=urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA223VN_0725@0.4866,0.5697,0.3885,0.09640), we found an intermarginal scholion that also commented on the spelling of πόρδαλιος. This read: Δια τοῦ α αἱ Ἀριστ παρδ, meaning that the editions of Aristarchus spelled πόρδαλιος with an α.

Also in the Venetus A, we found a main scholion that comments on the order of the animals, specifically the use of both (σῦς) and (κάπρος) to refer to the boar.

>οὔτε συος κάπρου: κατ επίτασιν - ἀλκιμωτερος γὰρ ὁ κάπρος· δι ὃ ἐπὶ πᾶσι τέτακται οὐ κ’ἄλλα διὰ τὸ θυμικώτερον εἶναι τὸν κάπρον τῶν ἄλλων ζώων ἐπενήνοχε προς αὔξησιν καὶ ἔστιν σῦς μὲν τὸ γενικὸν , κάπρος δὲ τὸ εἰδικον , ἀπο τοῦ κάπτειν⁑

>According to intensification.  For the boar (καπρος) is more combative. Therefore, it applies to all (συος). || No, it has been put after everything because the καπρος is more vehement than the other animals, for he added it for the purposes of intensification. And συς is the word indicating the genus but καπρος is the word indicating the species, from καπτω (to gulp down). (Translated by Ineke Sluiter, Leonie Henkes, Natalie DiMattia, and Abigail Smith)

This scholion, according to Erbse, has two writers who are commenting on each other, shown by the separation at οὐ. The scribes have slightly different reasonings, but both agree that the placement is for the purpose of intensification.

The Venetus A and the “Twins” both have main scholia that refer to the word order of the animals in this simile. However, they have two different approaches to the text. The Venetus A scholion is focused on specific etymologies and editorial questions. The “Twins” are focused on the broader idea of what “Homer” is trying to accomplish with the symbolism of the animals.

Also, the secondhand additional scholia of the “Twins” are, following the pattern of the Venetus A, more concerned with specific matters and finding the “correct” way to read the text, while the original scholia accept what is present in the text and attempt to defend or understand “Homer’s” literary choices.

So where do we go from here?

We propose that, in order to further explore the motivations of the various scholia, the secondhand scholia of this “Twins” should be edited. Doing this, we hope to be able to understand the humanistic motivations behind the various secondhand scholia compared to those of the original scribes. Perhaps, what we noticed reflects a larger trend in the scholia of the Venetus B and Upsilon 1.1.
